Kyo
---
>Kyo feature tests using Scala 3.

Note
----
>Kyo is the latest competitor to Scalaz, Cats and Zio.

>While the simplest of all 4, Kyo still feels cumbersome compared to standard Scala.

>Effects are *relatively* straightforward to work with and test; while conncurrent effects are not.

>Kyo is still a work-in-progress, though.
