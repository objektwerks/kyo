Kyo
---
>Kyo feature tests using Scala 3.

Note
----
>Kyo is the latest competitor to Cats and Zio.

>While the simplest of all 3, Kyo still feels cumbersome compared to standard Scala.

>Kyo effects are *relatively* straightforward to work with and test; while concurrent effects are not.

>Kyo is still a work-in-progress, though. Moreover, I'm no Kyo guru. :)
